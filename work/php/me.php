            <p>My name is Ahmad Abdulal, born and raised in Damascus, Syria. I moved to Sweden five years ago. I have studied a specializd program in accounting in school.
               After that, I studied one year at The Banking Institute where for some reason we had that one course for web programming which got me interested in programming.</p>

            <p>My other interests beside programming are music, food and playing online-games with friends.</p>
            <p>Looking forward to gain experience from this course.</p>
