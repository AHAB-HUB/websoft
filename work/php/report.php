      <div style="padding-top:10px">1) Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</div>
      <div>I did use git and github before in the previous project courses we had at school.
        However, Markdown and GitHub Pages are new to me.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">2) Have you ever created websites before?</div>
      <div>No, but I have created some small pages using HTML to print a text.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">3) Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</div>
      <div>I don’t have any previous experience regard web application development.
        However, I know some of the famous frameworks that are used in development.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">4) What is your TIL for this course section?</div>
      <div>I got to learn about new techniques such as GitHub pages and markdown. I learned how to keep the forked repository up to date.
        In addition to how to add/remove tags and their usefulness.
        I learned that when I clone a forked repository locally by GitHub desktop application,
        the application will automatically add the master remote under the name "upstream".

      <h2>S02</h2>
      <div style="width:100%;height:1.5px;background-color:black"></div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">1) Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</div>
      <div>We have used css before in many courses where we used javaFX to create applications. Each element in javaFX uses CSS.
        However, I dont have any experience with HTML or javascript.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">2) Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</div>
      <div>HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.
        CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout.
        JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">3) Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</div>
      <div>A browser communicates with a web server through HTTP protocol.
        A browser makes a request to a web server to return a specific resource such as an image, video or webpage.
        Depending on the authenticity of the request, a server then returns the requested resource.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">4) What is your TIL for this course section?</div>
      <div>I got to create my first page in this course. I made a lot of errors using html and css and got to learn how to avoid them in the future. </div>

      <h2>S03</h2>
      <div style="width:100%;height:1.5px;background-color:black"></div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">1) Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</div>
      <div>No, i dont have any previous experience of client side JavaScript.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">2) Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</div>
      <div>I wouldn't copmare JavaScript to any other programming laanguage because it has its own unique structure. For instance, functions can be created at any place without even assigning aa name to the function. Also, a function can be created
        within another function which is whaat makes this language unique in my opinion.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">3) Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</div>
      <div>Well, it took me three days to finish the whole assignment and I think it was a challenging one. I got stuck at some parts and got more errors when i started to integrate the moveable object to all other HTML pages. However, I believe that
        I managed to fullfil the requirements for grade 5.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">4) What is your TIL for this course section?</div>
      <div>I learned mostly about positioning and transitions in CSS. I started to avoid using fixed values for positioning and scale size so the page would render a bit more better.</div>

      <h2>S04</h2>
      <div style="width:100%;height:1.5px;background-color:black"></div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">1) Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.?</div>
      <div>It is my first time using node/npm and I have never heard about them before. I spent a lot of time watching youtube tutorial beside the exercise I did before working on this assignment.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">2) How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</div>
      <div>I feel very confident with what I know so far. However, there still a lot to learn and many bugs/errors might occur during future coding which will lead to further researchs.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">3) Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</div>
      <div>I read the assignment and I heard about the strugles my friends were facing. I started watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-7RQ46RgxU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp">youtube tutorial</a> which have covered all I needed to complete this assignment. Then, I divided the assignment into several tasks to implement them in order  so I dont get lost in the middle of the coding process. I pushed to Github as soon i finish one of the tasks. </div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">4) What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</div>
      <div>Grade 5. It was challenging and difficult because it is still new to me and the instructions were not so clear at some point.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">5) What is your TIL for this course section?</div>
      <div>I improved my experience more and I got to use new elements with no errors. I learned about nodeJS and npm and some other libraries/packages that made the ide look more organized.</div>

      <h2>S05</h2>
      <div style="width:100%;height:1.5px;background-color:black"></div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">1) How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</div>
      <div>I still dont know much about the language even though I did all the requirements for this assignment. I still need to learn more about the language to be able to give a proper answer but overall I dont like it and wouldnt choose to work with it in my future career.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">2) Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</div>
      <div>I would not compare it to any other languages since it has its unique style and structuce.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">3) Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</div>
      <div>I watched some tutorials and got some help from my friends whenever i got stuck with an error. I am satisfied with what I did and my aim is to get a 5.</div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">2) What is your TIL for this course section?</div>
      <div>I learned a bit about the programming language PHP. I got to use different methods to connect to the database. </div>

      <h2>S06</h2>
      <div style="width:100%;height:1.5px;background-color:black"></div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">1) What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</div>
      <div>each programming language has its way of being popular. Each language will be more popular when it offers more frameworks and features that would help the users to build specific software. However, many languages would help to build software such as web application, but each will have more/less features and frameworks. Such as JavaScript which has the most popular frameworks in web development.  </div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">2) What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</div>
      <div> In general, I would go with Java since it can be used to build software that works on multiple platforms. However, web development-wise I would choose JS since it has a lot to offer and it is the future programming language in its field. </div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">3) Do your own investigation on <a href="https://trends.googlecom">https://trends.google.com </a> to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.</div>
      <div>This investigation aimed to compare two programming languages that have been used for web development for a long time to detect if there are any changes in their popularity by the help of <a href="https://trends.googlecom">https://trends.googlecom</a>. Below, a graph is taken from google trends that shows how much people have used the words JavaScript and PHP in their search.
      <img src="./img/trendChart.png" style="max-width:-webkit-fill-available" alt="chart"/>The graph shows that PHP has higher popularity than JavaScript from 2004 to 2020. But people started to search for JavaScript more than PHP from the beginning of 2014.  </div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">4) If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</div>
      <div>Choosing a programming language and what framework is not an easy task since all relay on the software requirements. However, I would advise using JavaScript and one for the two frameworks, react and angular. JavaScript offers a fast time of compilation. Framework-wise, I would say react since it has a better score than angular on google trends. However, I would go with angular rather than react at the moment because it is rich with libraries and features that react does not support, yet. </div>
      <div style="padding-top:10px">5) What is your TIL for this course section?</div>
      <div>During this period, I have learned how to program using PHP. PHP has an interesting structure in a way that differs from other programming languages.</div>
